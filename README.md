# JavaScript Null Value Handling
This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript related to handling null values. The `foo` function adds two numbers, but it explicitly checks for null values before performing the addition. This approach prevents runtime errors from occurring, but it may not be ideal in all cases.

## Bug Description
The current implementation handles null values by simply returning null. This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging difficult if null values are returned unexpectedly. For example, if the function was used in a larger program, the null result might not be easily identifiable as the source of a later error.

## Improvement Suggestion
More robust error handling, such as throwing an exception or logging an error, could improve the code's ability to pinpoint the source of a problem. This approach can enhance the program's reliability and make it easier to debug. Also, consider what types of values the function might handle and how to deal with unexpected or invalid input.
